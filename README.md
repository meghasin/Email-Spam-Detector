# Spam-detection
In this work, we have a) conducted a comparative study to understand the effectiveness of decision tree, random forest and SVM with K-means for feature selection to detect spam and b) proposed an approach using K-means clustering with Neural Network which gave improved accuracy and computational cost 


This approach displayed improved accuracy and reduced computational cost. An accuracy of 76% was achieved with the combination of Random forest and K-means clustering.
